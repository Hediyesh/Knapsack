**Knapsack Algorithm**
<br>
This repository contains an implementation of the Knapsack algorithm in python using Flask for solving the Knapsack Problem.

**Overview**
<br>
The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to select a subset of items with maximum total value, subject to a constraint on the total weight of the selected items. The algorithm implemented in this repository provides a solution to this problem.

**Usage**
When you run the program, you can enter the capacity of bag with the number of items. Then enter the weights and values of items and click on the button. Now you can see the bag with the items that were fit in it with their percentages.
